        <h3>Project: Typing speed</h3>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The aim of this project is to create a webpage where the user can <span class="questions">check his typing speed</span>. The user is given a text and they must type it fully with as less mistakes as possible.</p>


        <p>Various statistics can be computed:
          <ul style="list-style: inside">
            <li><span class="questions">CPM</span> (Characters per minute): number of alphanumeric characters per minute</li>
            <li><span class="questions">WPM</span> (Words per minute): number of words per minute. A word can be defined as having, on average, 5 characters.</li>
            <li><span class="questions">Accuracy</span>: ratio between the number of valid characters vs the total number of typed characters.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p> You can see an <span class="questions">example</span> of the expected result in the video below. The goal is not to reproduce this example, but to design your own webpage and implement your own ideas. Any personal initiative is <span class="questions">strongly encouraged.</span> </p>

        </video>

         <h4> Milestones </h4>
        <p> Here are the main steps to help you create a <span class="questions">basic typing speed test</span>. This is to get you started,  you are encouraged to go further than those steps.</p>

        <p> Steps: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Setup the HTML and CSS file. Create a basic webpage with the HTML tags required for typing and displaying information.</li>
            <li>Handling user input. Detect when the user types, and compute statistics from it. There is no need to check what the user types against the text at this stage.</li>
            <li>Check keyboard input versus text. Add a text in the HTML page and check that the user input is valid. Update statistics accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Submission </h4>
        The project must be submitted by <span class="questions">Wednesday, 7th June 2023</span> at florent.grelard [at] u-bordeaux.fr.

        The files to attach are:
        <ul style="list-style: inside">
            <li>Code: zip file containing HTML, CSS and Javascript file</li>
            <li>Written report: docx or pdf</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The report should be around 5 pages, written in English. It should be structured into sections:
           <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Introduction: describe the aim of the project</li>
            <li>Analysis: describe your own take on the project, listing each main task and feature (e.g. <i>"Computing typing statistics: CPM, WPM and Accuracy"</i>). This section should be in plain English, without any code.</li>
            <li>Implementation: describe how you actually implemented each task programmatically. Here you should describe the main coding element(s) that helped you solve a task. A few code snippets can be included here. Only include <span class="questions">relevant parts</span> of your code, not its entirety. </li>
             <li>Conclusion: conclude on the limitations of your code, and propose a few perspectives and features that could be added.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
